# artPrints

A web application me and the other developers were working on as a prototype to the actual project during my time in an internship recently. This project is a website which is similar to your usual online shopping website where the user clicks on a product of their choice, add to basket and order. 

# Lessons learned

This project was the first time I was using a new programming language to implement it in PHP. Was able to add new details, information and make changes to the website without the need to use elementor to manually add and delete stuff.

# Possible future features

When changes are applied to the website, it has to be adapatable and more responsive even on smaller devices such as mobile phones. 

# Deployment
